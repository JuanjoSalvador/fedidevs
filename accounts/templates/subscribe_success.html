                ... I have to admit that I have not implemented this feature yet. I'll implement it once I get at least <b>10</b> subscribers, so if you know anyone else who might be interested please ask them to subscribe as well.
            </p>
            <p>Once the feature is ready you won't have to resubscribe, you'll automatically start receving daily posts.</p>
            <p>Thank you! 🙏</p>
